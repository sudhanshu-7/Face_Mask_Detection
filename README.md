# Face_Mask_Detection
In this project, I used the Convolutional Neural Network algorithm to classify whether a person is wearing a
face mask on or not. In this COVID era, we have to co-exist with the threats of the
virus and wearing a mask reduces chances of virus transmission from one body to
other.

A Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take
in an input image, assign importance to various aspects/objects in the image and be
able to differentiate one from the other. While in primitive methods filters are hand-
engineered, with enough training, CNN have the ability to learn these
filters/characteristics.
